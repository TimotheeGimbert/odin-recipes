Ok, so back to basics with this starter html project.
Current personnal objective is to finish the odin project Foundations course in 3 weeks.
I am currently at 33% after few days, starting to be confortable with some aspects of web Dev ... Can't wait to make sense with all of this...

I should precise to my future self that I am currently working between 10 and 15 hours per day, so 3 days is more like a week of work. So my estimation to finish in 3 weeks seems fair.
